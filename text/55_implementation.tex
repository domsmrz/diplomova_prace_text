\chapter{Implementation}

The goal of this chapter is to summarize the architecture of the underlying implementation and general design. For the detailed guide on how to use it for \gls{iden} generation on a new data please read \autoref{ch:guide}. For the implementation details, please refer to attached code.

As we mentioned in the \autoref{sec:vl}, whole our work is designed as a module for \gls{VL}. Even though our work is largely independent of other modules within the framework of \gls{VL}, it shares one main component and that is the database. We use the database as an \gls{api} for communication for other modules as well as a place to store our intermediate results.
