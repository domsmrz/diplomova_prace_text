Increasing usage of surveillance cameras brought the need for automatic object
re-identification.  The goal of the re-identification is to match the same
object (usually a person) across multiple cameras, or across different frames
of a single camera. This problem has many different application not only
directly in security but also in areas such as traffic monitoring and robotics.
Despite the extensive advancement in computer vision and artificial
intelligence re-identification still remains open problem.

Our task is to create a module for \gls{VL} -- an analytical system
for video surveillance. The purpose of this module is to perform
re-identification task on the videos within the system.

Aside from the actual re-identification algorithm, we present an entire
framework encapsulating the issue. We implement an easy-to-use pipleline, that
can be used for testing other approaches to the problem. We also implement
simple, yet effective, tool for annotation, that can be also used for
in-depth analysis of any given re-identification algorithm. Finally, we also
present the set of other utilities, used for evaluation of various
re-identification algorithms and other related tasks.
