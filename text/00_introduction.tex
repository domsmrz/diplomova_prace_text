Increasing usage of surveillance cameras brought the need for automatic object re-identification.  The re-identification goal is to match the same object (usually a person) across multiple cameras or different frames of a single camera. This problem has many different applications not only directly in security but also in traffic monitoring and robotics. Despite the extensive advancement in computer vision and artificial intelligence, re-identification remains an open problem.

Our task is to create a module for \gls{VL} -- an analytical system for video surveillance. The purpose of this module is to perform a re-identification task on the videos within the system.

Aside from the actual re-identification algorithm, we present an entire framework encapsulating the issue. We implement an easy-to-use pipeline that can be used for testing other approaches to the problem. We also implement a simple yet effective annotation tool that can also be used for in-depth analysis of any given re-identification algorithm. Finally, we also present other utilities used to evaluate various re-identification algorithms and other related tasks.
