% TODO: Motivation

We created a system for processing the video streams in order to
allow easy evaluation of various statistical tasks.

Specificly, in this thesis we present the part of this workflow, that is responsible
for already prepered detections into groups of identities. Meaning that the input of our
part of the programm will be prepared detections (in terms of crops of the frames from
a video with additional meta-data) and the output would be groupping of such detections,
where detections from one group would display the same object.
